# Simon Says Game

A browser-based memory challenge built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Watch a growing sequence of colored buttons light up, then repeat the pattern by clicking or tapping in the same order. Each correct round advances your level; one mistake ends the game and shows your score (with a high-score tracker). Fully responsive and mobile-friendly, with tactile press animations and flash effects—no external libraries required.
